A library for simulating fluid flows and transport in heterogeneous porous
media. The control volume finite element method (CVFE) is used on unstructured
two- and three-dimensional meshes.

Parallelism is supported by combinations of MPI-CUDA and MPI-OpenMP.

This code is still in very early development and changing rapidly, so don't use
it for anything that matters!

Written by Ben Cumming and Tim Moroney.

We cannot provide any support for the library in its current form.
